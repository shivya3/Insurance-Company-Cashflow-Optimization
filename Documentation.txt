SILENT=TRUE
When I give silent as the last argument to tabula.read_pdf(), the mere existence of silent keyword causes it to be considered as True. 

Setup()
This function initializes the training environment and creates the transformation pipeline. Setup function must be called before executing 
any other function. It takes two mandatory parameters: data and target. All the other parameters are optional.
The setup function performs several imperative steps required in machine learning such as cleaning missing values (if any), splitting the 
data into train and test, setting up cross validation strategy, defining metrics, performing algorithm-specific transformations etc.

compare_models()
The Compare model function trains and evaluates performance of all estimators in the model library.
The output of this function is a score grid with average cross validated scores.
The magic function that trains multiple models, compares and evaluates performance metrics is compare_models. It returns the best model 
based on ‘sort’ parameter that can be defined inside compare_models. By default, it uses ‘R2’ for regression use-case and ‘Accuracy’ for 
classification use-case.

finalize_model()
Finalize model function trains a given estimator on the entire dataset including.
Rest of the lines are for finalizing the best model returned through compare_models and saving it as a pickle file in your local diretory. 
Last line returns the dataframe with details of model trained and their performance metrics.
